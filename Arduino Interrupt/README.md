- First upload this code to your Arduino UNO and the LED ligts up. 
- Then take one male to male jumper and attach the one end of jumper to the digital pin 2 and another end to the GND. 
- When the pin is attached at both end, the interrupt is fired which causes the arduino
to wake up and lights the pin.
